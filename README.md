# WTH is the Jamstack?

This repo contains the slides for the talk I gave at [PHP Lisbon #3](https://phplisbon.com/meetups/meetup-3).

Talk consists of:

- What is the Jamstack?
- How does it compare to other stacks?
- When to use it?

## How to run

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

The browser will open automatically.

## How to build

```bash
yarn build
```

Preview your slides with

```bash
npx http-server dist
```

If everything is ok, you should be able to see the slides at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
